"""
send_morning_notification.py — sends the "today's edition is live" push
notification. Runs on its own schedule (7:30 AM IST), separate from
generation (2:00 AM IST), so content is ready well before the notification
goes out.

Requires FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON. Reads data/latest.json, which must
already exist (i.e. daily-edition.yml must have run first that day).
